# Dog Breed Classifier
> Convolutional Neural Networks

This project aims at successfully classifying dog breeds using convolutional neural networks

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get the classifier up &
running.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/abhigyan2311/dog-breed-classifier.git
cd dog-breed-classifier
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate deeplearning
jupyter notebook classifier.ipynb
```

## Features

The classifier notebook implements the following methods:
* Human Face Detection
* Dog Detection
* Dog Breed Classification from scratch
* Dog Breed Classification using VGG-16 as base model in transfer learning

The best accuracy was achieved using transfer learning of 70%.
